## Hello, World! 👋

I am a senior at Lehman College, working toward my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and set to graduate in Spring 2026. My academic journey has pushed me to think critically, build creatively, and develop a strong foundation in software development — especially as I work toward becoming a web developer in the tech industry. I’m driven by the idea of creating clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences that people actually enjoy using.

Outside of tech, I’ve played basketball my entire life. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to appreciate the game from both sides — playing it and watching it — though nothing beats being on the court. Basketball has shaped the way I approach challenges: with discipline, consistency, and a willingness to improve every day. I also stay active through regular workouts, which helps me stay focused, energized, and balanced while tackling demanding projects and coursework.

I’m excited to continue growing as a developer, building real-world projects, and carving out my place in the tech world. Every new skill, every project, and every challenge brings me one step closer to the career I’m working toward.
