## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at Lehman College and am expected to graduate with a Bacherlors of Science in Computer Science in the Fall 2025 semester. 

I've played basketball my whole life and as I got older I've come to enjoy watching it as well (playing the game will always be more fun).
